\title{Hardness Results for Simple Partition Number}

\date{\today}

\maketitle

\TODO{We wish to submit this to ISIT 2019 (deadline: January 13, 2019).
Towards this, we have the following goals for Simple Partition Number.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Show formally that computing a simple partition is NP-hard/complete.
	In particular, we can consider first the decision problem of whether or not a graph $G$ has a simple partition of size at most $2$, and try to show this problem is NP-hard/complete.
	Starting with bipartite graphs and maybe trying to show for general graphs.
	
	\item Formally prove \theoremref{reduction} below.
	This will show we have a quartic, non-convex program for computing sp which will always terminate to an integer solution.
	
	\item Try to generalize our program and/or hardness reduction to weighted sp or other variants of sp.
	
	\item Try to show hardness of approximation of sp, similar to that of bp.
	
	\item Give at least one or two applications of sp.
	Recall example of $n$ students needing to meet with some $m$ teachers in one big room, minimize number of hours required, or something of the like.
\end{enumerate}}
