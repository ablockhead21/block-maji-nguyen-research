\section{Secret Sharing Scheme over fields}
Let $\bbF$ and let $G \in \bbF^{\kappa \times \eta+1}$ be of the form $[I_{\kappa \times \kappa}\Vert P_{\kappa \times \eta - \kappa + 1}]$, where $P$ is a random Toeplitz matrix with elements of $\bbF$.
We write $G = [G_0\Vert G']$, where $G_0$ is the first column of $G$.
Given $\cI \subseteq [\eta]$, we let $G_\cI$ denote the columns of $G'$ indexed by $\cI$.
We say a set of columns $\cI$ in $G$ is qualified for $G_0$ if $G_0$ is in the span of $G_\cI$.
Such a set $\cI$ is minimally qualified for $G_0$ if no proper subset of $\cI$ is qualified for $G_0$.
We show an important property about such matrices.


Consider now a family of $[\eta + 1, \kappa]_\bbF$ linear codes $\{C\}$ generated by a family of $\{ G = [I_{\kappa \times \kappa}\Vert P] \}$, where $P$ is a random Toeplitz matrix over $\bbF$ of dimension $\kappa \times (\eta - \kappa + 1)$.
Let $\{C^\perp\}$ denote the family of $[\eta + 1, \eta - \kappa + 1]_\bbF$ dual codes generated by a family of matrices $\{H\}$, noting that for $G = [I_{\kappa \times \kappa}\Vert P]$ we have $H = [-P^\top \Vert I_{(\eta-\kappa + 1)\times (\eta-\kappa+1)}]$.
