	\begin{theorem}[High Resilience High Production Correlation Extractor]
	\label{thm:construction}
	For all constants $0<\delta<g<1/2$, there exists a correlation $(R_A,R_B)$, where each party gets $n$-bit secret share, such that there exists a two-round $(n,m,t,\eps)$-correlation extractor for $(R_A,R_B)$, where $m=(\delta n)^{1-o(1)}$, $t=(\nicefrac12-g)n$, and $\eps=2^{-(g-\delta)n/2}$. 
	%There exists a correlation $(R_A,R_B)$, where each party gets an $n$-bit secret share, such that there exists a two-round $(n,n^{1-o(1)},(\nicefrac12-g)n,2^{-gn/2})$-correlation extractor for $(R_A,R_B)$, for all positive constants $g<1/2$.
